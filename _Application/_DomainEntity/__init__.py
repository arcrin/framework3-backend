Summary of Domain Entities' Role and Boundaries

1. Session: Acts as the bridge between the user and the application, determining access type (control view).
The single control session ensures there's one "master" of the testing process, while view sessions for monitoring
without interfering with control.

2. Panel: Represents a physical placeholder for the unit, with a future focus on configuring the test jig based 
on the panel's position. This aligns well with real-world constraints where configuration may vary by panel location.

3. Test Run: Provides a framework for managing the lifecycle of tests on each panel, enforcing rules such as one test 
run per panel at a time, which prevents overlapping test executions.

4. Test Case and Parameters: Allow users to interact with and view test at a detailed level. TestCaseDataModel provides
a user-friendly view, while TCNode models the workflow execution, maintaining a clean distinction between the user
interface and backend operations.

5. Test Jig: Will serve as the central hardware controller, requiring initial setup and configuration before each test
run. Given its central role in interfacing with the hardware, it will likely encapsulate configuration and operational 
details specific to the testing equipment.

Next Steps and Considerations
- Session Management: Since sessions can vary in nature (control vs. view), implementing clear session lifecycle 
management will be essential. This includes starting, ending, and transferring sessions if the control session is 
handed over to another user.
- Panel and Test Jig Configuration: The interaction between panels and the test jig may involve more complex mapping.
A configuration service or mapping layer could link each panel to its required jig configuration service or mapping
layer could link each panel to its required jig configuration based on position.
- Hardware Initialization and Shutdown: The Test Jig entity could define methods for hardware setup and teardown, 
ensuring that each test run begins with the correct configuration and that resources are properly released afterward.


Strict hierarchy with a compositional relationship
Pros:
1. Clear Ownership and Responsibility
    - Definition: Each component (e.g., Session, Panel, TestRun) clearly owns its sub-components.
    - Advantage: This simplifies understanding of data flows, as every operation occurs within a well-defined owner-subordinate 
    structure.
    - Example in Context: A Session owns its Panels, which own their TestRun. This makes it easy to reason about where 
    operations should happen and where state changes reside.

2. Encapsulation
    - Definition: Each component fully encapsulates its responsibilities and state.
    - Advantage: Changes to one component's internal logic do not affect others, reducing unintended side effects and making
    testing easier.
    - Example in Context: Modifying the behavior of TestRun would not directly impact Panel or Session

3. Predictable Lifecycle
    - Definition: The lifecycle of sub-components is directly tied to their parent.
    - Advantage: Components like Panel and TestRun cannot outlive their parent Session. This reduces errors related to dangling 
    references or inconsistent states.
    - Example in Context: When a Session ends, all associated Panels and TestRuns are automatically terminated.

4. Natural Representation of Real-World Systems
    - Definition: The hierarchy mirrors real-world relationships, making the code intuitive.
    - Advantage: Easier to align the software model with hardware or physical layouts, such as manufacturing line.
    - Example in Context: A test jig (modeled by Session) contains multiple panels, each executing tests sequentially-matching
    the physical setup.

5. Simpler Data Flows
    - Definition: Data flows naturally from parent to child in a top-down manner.
    - Advantage: No need for complex dependency management or event propagation between unrelated components.
    - Example in Context: Test configuration or session-level parameters flow from Session to Panel to TestRun.

Cons
1. Limited Flexibility
    - Definition: Astrict hierarchy can make it difficult to represent relationships or operations that span multiple branches 
    of the hierarchy.
    - Disadvantage: Operations requiring cross-component communication (e.g., sharing data between Panels) may require workarounds
    like event buses or higher-level orchestrators.
    - Example inContext: If test results from one Panel need to influence another, it would be harder to implement.

2. Tight Coupling of Lifecycle
    - Definition: Sub-components depend entirely on their parent's lifecycle.
    - Disadvantage: This can make testing or reusing sub-components(e.g., TestRun) independently of their parent challenging.
    - Example in Context: Testing a TestRun might require mock Panel and Session objects, adding complexity.

3. Potential Overhead in Parent-Driven Actions
    - Definition: Every action or state change in sub-component might need to originate from or involve its parent.
    - Disadvantage: This can create bottlenecks or inefficiencies, especially in systems requiring frequent updates or high
    responsiveness.
    - Example in Context: If every TestRun state change needs validation from its parent Panel, it could slow down processing.

4. Top-Down Design Restricts Alternative Data Flows
    - Definition: Data must flow form parent to child, which may not always align with logical workflows.
    - Disadvantage: Child components cannot "push" data directly to their parents or siblings, requiring event-driven architectures
    or intermediate data stores.
    - Example in Context: If a TestRun failure needs to notify the Session, it must use the SystemEventBus, adding complexity.

5. Difficulty Scaling Beyond Simple Hierarchies
    - Definition: If the system becomes more complex, maintaining a strict hierarchy can lead to rigid structures.
    - Disadvantage: it may become harder  to adapt to changes, such as introducing parallel hierarchies or new relationships.
    - Example in Context: Adding a new entity, like a "shared resource" between Panels, could break the strict hierarchy.

Alternatives to Strict Hierarchies
- Event-Driven Architectures:
    - Instead of strict parent-child interactions, use events to propagate information or trigger actions.
    - Pro: Increases flexibility and decouples components.
    - Con: Adds complexity and requires robust event handling.

- Shared service Layers:
    - Introduce shared services (e.g., TestManager, PanelManager) to mediate interactions between components.
    - Pro: Reduces direct dependencies between components.
    - Con: Can blur the boundaries of responsibility.
    
- Partial Hierarchies:
    - Allow strict hierarchies only where they make sense (e.g., Panel to TestRun), while relaxing them elsewhere.
    - Pro: Balances structure and flexibility
    - Con: Requires careful design to avoid introducing unintended dependencies.

Suitability for Your System
Given your automated testing setup:
    - The strict hierarchy with composition seems highly appropriate for representing physical relationships
    (e.g., Session -> Panel -> TestRun).
    - Using the SystemEventBus for upward communication mitigates many disadvantages, as it decouples parent-child
    interactions and allows flexible data propagation.
