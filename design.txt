Modular Design: Given that the script format will evolve over time, it's crucial to design a system that is highly modular. This allows for easy adaptation to new script formats without requiring major overhauls.

Script Interpreter/Adapter: Implement an interpreter or adapter pattern that can read various script formats and convert them into a standard internal format for execution. This ensures flexibility in accepting different script types.

API Design: Since the hardware team will provide APIs, ensure your software is designed to integrate seamlessly with these APIs. Good API integration will be key to interacting with the hardware components.

Error Handling and Logging: Robust error handling and comprehensive logging are essential, especially in a manufacturing environment where diagnosing issues quickly is crucial.

Parallel Execution and Queue Management: If the hardware allows, design for parallel execution of tests to increase throughput. Implementing an efficient queue management system for test scripts might be necessary.
