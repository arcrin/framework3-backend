"""
The NodeFailureProcessor class is designed to handle node processing failures by determining
whether a failed node (specifically a TCNode) should be retired or quarantined based on its 
properties. Here are some suggestions and best properties. Here are some suggestions and best 
practices to enhance its robustness, functionality, and maintainability.
    1. Error Handling and Robustness
        - Graceful Error Handling: Implement more robus error handling around the operations
        check_dependency_and_schedule_self and quarantine. These methods might throw exceptions
        that should be caught and handled to ensure the failure processor doesn't crash.

        - Logging: Add detailed logging at critical steps of the process, such as when a node
        is retired or quarantined, and when errors occur. This will aid in debugging and monitoring 
        the system''s behavior.

    2. Concurrency and Resource Management
        - Resource Management: Ensure that the nursery doesn't spawn an unbounded number of tasks 
        if a large number of nodes fail simultaneously. Consider using a semaphore or a similar 
        mechanism to limit the number of concurrent operations if necessary.

        - Cancellation and Timeouts: Implement timeout or cancellation logic for retries or quarantine
        operations that take too long or hand indefinitely. This prevents resource exhaustion from stalled
        tasks.
        
    3. Functionality Improvements
        - Retry Logic: Enhance the retry logic by implementing a backoff strategy for retries to avoid 
        immediate and repeated retries that could exacerbate system issues.

        - Failure Analysis: Incorporate more sophisticated logic to analyze the failure reasons and
        determine the best course of action based on those reasons, potentially beyond just retry counts.

    4. Testing and Validation
        - Unit Testing: Write comprehensive tests for this class, particularly testing the retry and 
        quarantine functionalities under various scenarios. Mock TCNode methods to simulate different
        behaviors and failure conditions.

        - Integration Testing: Test the integration with the rest of the system, especially how it interacts
        with the channel system and other node processors. Ensure that the failure processor works
        harmoniously within the larger system architecture.
